# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science

Here is a list of some Machine Learning and Data Science projects I have completed.

They have all been deployed with Amazon Sagemaker, ECR, ECS, and Docker containers in AWS

More detailed explanations are available with the code.


MNIST CLASSIFIER:
Created a voting classifier using random forest classifier, extra trees classifier, linear support vector classifier, and multilayer perceptron classifier.
Also created a Stacking Ensemble with a blender to compare our result with the voting classifier.
Code was written in Python with Scikit-Learn and Numpy.


CLUSTERING/PREPROCESSING MAKE_MOONS:
Created a cluster of the make_moons dataset using DBSCAN, KNeighbors, Spectral Clustering, and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model.
Code was written in Python using Scikit-Learn, Numpy, and Matplotlib.


GENERATING FASHION MNIST PICTURES WITH DCGANs:
Created a DCGANs that generates grayscale images using a generator and discriminator.
Code was written in Python using Tensorflow, Keras, and Numpy.


GENERATING SHAKESPREARE TEXT WITH NLP RNN:
Created a Recursive Neurel Network which trains on Shakespeare text that is capable of generating fake Shakespeare text.
Code was written in Python using Tensorflow, Keras, and Numpy.
